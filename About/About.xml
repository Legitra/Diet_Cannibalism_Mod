	<description>Have a colony of cannibals that eat the bodies of their victims too quickly? Put them on a diet!
	
This mod adds a new type of simple meal created from a minimum of 1 human meat. These meals can then be limited to exactly 1 human meat per meal by disallowing human meat in the bills menu.
