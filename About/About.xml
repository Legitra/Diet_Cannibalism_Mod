	<description># Diet_Cannibalism_Mod  
Have a colony of cannibals that eat the bodies of their victims too quickly? Put them on a diet!

### This mod adds the following recipes;  
- Simple cannibal meals require 1 human meat + anything else.
- Fine cannibal meals require 2 human meat + other meats + veg.
- lavish cannibal meals require 4 human meat + other meats + veg.

### Exact nutrition requirements of the new recipes; 

|   | Simple| Fine| Lavish|
|---|---|---|---|
| Human Meat Nutrition|0.05|0.1| 0.2|
| Other Nutrition|0.45 Any Raw Food |0.24 Meats or Animal Products + 0.25 Plants|0.3 Meats or Animal Products + 0.5 Plants|

Disallowing human meat in bills menu will disallow the meals from using any more human meat than required (i.e. simple meals wont use any more than 1 piece).
