	<description>Have a colony of cannibals that eat the bodies of their victims too quickly? Put them on a diet!

	
This mod adds a new type of simple meal created from a minimum of 1 human meat. These meals can then be limited to exactly 1 human meat per meal by disallowing human meat in the bills menu.


This mod add the following meals;

Simple cannibal meals require 1 human meat + anything else.
Fine cannibal meals require 2 human meat + other meats + veg.
lavish cannibal meals require 4 human meat + other meats + veg.

Disallow human meat in the bills menu to restrict the meals to minimum required human meat (and keep the cannibals on their diet).
