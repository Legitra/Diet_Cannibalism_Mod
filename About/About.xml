	<description>Have a colony of cannibals that eat the bodies of their victims too quickly? Put them on a diet!

This mod add the following meals;

Simple cannibal meals require 1 human meat + anything else.
Fine cannibal meals require 2 human meat + other meats + veg.
lavish cannibal meals require 4 human meat + other meats + veg.

Disallow human meat in the bills menu to restrict the meals to minimum required human meat (and keep the cannibals on their diet).
